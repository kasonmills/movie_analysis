# movie_analysis
This is a simple code to analyze movies contained in a data base and to ask questions regarding the data within. This project is to improve my skills as a software developer. My purpose in analyzing the data is to see if there are patterns that can be observed with movies and how they are rated.

Data Analysis Results

Question one: Is there a connection between the popularity of a movie and a higher rating out of ten?

Question two: Are there a higher rating on average for movies that have come out more recently?

Future Work

1. Ask more questions to see how extensive the database is
2. learn more about Pandas so that I can learn how to better filter the data.
3. Incorporate some visualization so that the data is more easily understood instead of just being display on a terminal
4. discover outliers in the data (if they exist)
5. discover if this data set is even worth evaluating (large enough sample size, ratings reflect the general audience, etc)
